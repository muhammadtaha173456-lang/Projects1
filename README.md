Chain Text Generator

This project is a simple AI-inspired text generator built in Python.  
It uses a **Markov chain** to learn word patterns from a given sample text and then generates new random sentences that sound a bit like the original.

1. The program takes in some sample text.  
2. It builds a "chain" of word pairs â†’ possible next words.  
3. It uses this chain to generate new random text that mimics the style of the input.  

This is one of the classic approaches to text generation before modern large language models like ChatGPT



Number Guessing Game

A simple interactive game built with Python where the computer picks a random number and the player tries to guess it.  
The program gives hints if your guess is too high or too low.  

This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates basic Python logic, loops, and user input handling.


How It Works
1. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 50.  
2. The player enters a guess.  
3. The program tells the player if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.  
4. Repeat until the player guesses correctly.
